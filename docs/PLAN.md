# Documentation Plan: README.md Upgrade

This plan outlines the updates required to bring the `README.md` in sync with the current SOTA 2026 capabilities of Skeptek.

## Missing Features to Document

### 1. Forensic Audio Analysis (New)
- **What:** The system now scrapes YouTube transcripts.
- **Why:** To find "micro-complaints" that reviewers say but don't write in descriptions.
- **Where:** Add to "The Agent Swarm" -> "Video Sniper".

### 2. Gamified Trust System (New)
- **What:** XP-based ranking (Cadet -> Watchtower -> Oracle) and Field Reports.
- **Why:** incentivizes high-quality community data contributions.
- **Where:** Add a new "Gamification & Community" section.

### 3. Chronological Value Logic (SOTA 2026) (New)
- **What:** Awareness of product release dates and successors (e.g., M1 vs M4).
- **Why:** "The Judge" now penalizes legacy hardware if priced unfairly.
- **Where:** Update "The Judge" agent description.

### 4. Technical Stack Update
- **What:** Add **Supabase** (Auth, Postgres, Realtime).
- **Why:** Essential part of the architecture.

## Proposed Structure Changes

1.  **Refine "The Pitch"**: Keep it punchy.
2.  **Update "The Agent Swarm"**:
    - **Market Scout**: Mention "Launch Date Tracking".
    - **Video Sniper**: Rename/Enhance to "Forensic Audio Scout" capability.
    - **The Judge**: Add "Chronological Context".
3.  **New Section: "Gamification"**: Explain the rank system.
4.  **Update "Tech Stack"**: Add Supabase.
